The XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) is planning to participate as a hosting organisation at the [Google Summer of Code 2022](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
If you are interested to participate as student (or simply new-commer to open-source), mentor or XMPP projects this is the page to start with!
 
If you can imagine to work full or part time in the summer on an open-source software project, then consider to join an XMPP real-time communication technology project and participate in the Google Summer of Code 2022!

### XMPP - the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol

XMPP is the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, a set of open technologies for instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, lightweight middle-ware, content syndication, and generalized routing of XML data. XMPP was originally developed in the Jabber open-source community to provide an open, decentralized alternative to the closed instant messaging services at that time.

### Google Summer of Code 2022

The Google Summer of Code is an international annual program in which Google awards stipends to contributors who successfully complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer. Project ideas are listed by host organizations involved in open-source software development, though students can also propose their own project ideas.
